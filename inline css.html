<body>
    <p style="background-color:blueviolet">Tendulkar was made the Icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian
        Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[305] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250,
        15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[306]<br><br>

        In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618
        runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was
        declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best
        Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[307] Tendulkar has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different
        seasons as a captain.[308] <br><br></p>


    <p style="background-color: cadetblue;"> Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of the second edition of the Champions League T20.
        He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after
        losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[309] <br><br>

        In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not
        out off 66 balls. In 2013, Tendulkar retired from Indian Premier League and in 2014 he was appointed as the
        Mumbai Indian's "Team Icon".[310][311] His last match for the team was the final of the 2013 Champions League,
        where he scored 14 runs in an Indians victory. In his 78 matches in the IPL, Tendulkar scored a total of 2,334
        runs; at the time of his retirement he was the fifth-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[312]
        Mumbai Indians retired his number 10 jersey as a tribute to Tendulkar.[313] He recently stepped down as the
        mentor of the franchise citing personal reasons.[314] <br><br></p>

    <p style="background-color:greenyellow ;">Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting
    style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that, "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique,
    compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar
    played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar".[319][320]<br><br></p>
